# JournalApp

JournalApp is a cross-platform journaling application I wrote in C# and built with .NET MAUI. It allows users to create, edit, and view journal entries with text and pictures. I was inspired by the Journal App on iOS 17 , and i decided to replicate it. It doesnt look as pleasing as the iOS Journal, thats a front end design thing, but it works well. This is the first release.

## Features

- **Create and Edit Journal Entries:** Add new journal entries with text and pictures. Edit existing entries.
- **View Journal Entries:** View a list of all journal entries on the main page.
- **Add Pictures:** Attach pictures to journal entries.
- **Delete and Edit Entries:** Remove or update existing entries.
- **Full-Screen Picture Viewing:** View attached pictures in full-screen mode(working on this).

## Planned Future Features
- **Add voice recordings, add location and bookmark journal entries.**
